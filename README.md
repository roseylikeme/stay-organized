## Description + Goal

I've created The Rose Project to showcase my journey and development in coding. With this particular project, my goal is to create a website that provides access to a back end data store containing users and ToDos.

Primary goal:
- Allow users to view the ToDo tasks of a specific registered user
- Allow users to ADD new ToDo tasks that are assigned to a user
